# Idea

The idea behind this project has been to develop a platform for the organisation "Teachers for future" where they had the possibility to gather all their material, all their information and all the content they would like to share and evaluate in one place. Furthermore, they wished for different quality-of-life features such as filtering, commenting, rating, etc. All of this has been implemented so that their workflow can be as fluent as possible.

# Why are there two projects like this?

I started with this one, which uses ReactJS as its front end framework.
However, after developing almost all the features for the platform I was not satisfied
with the way ReactJS works and how it manages it states.
I initially merely chose ReactJS to learn a new framework. So, I decided to build the whole
application one more time, but this time using AngularJS.
